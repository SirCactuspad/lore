# Roadmap
This is a proposed Roadmap for efforts made to expand the lore and story of Beyond All Reason

## TL:DR; 
How I would plan team effort on a story: do it in stages!
- Set a foundation that makes enough sense. Foundations are concrete.
- Figure out the important stuff that happened to make it so. 
- fill in the gaps
- add to the end of the timeline as needed, then fill in more gaps
##

### Stage 1: Setting
Nail down the specifics of the backstory/setting that need to be in place permanently. how does the BAR universe work? This should include specific decisions made on the high-level details. For example: Humans were the only known sentient life in the galaxy and now they're gone forever. This will need regular buy-in from game design team to make sure nothing is too off the mark from the current and planned game design.

The Deliverable: produce a backstory (high-level universe-changing details) that are set in stone. Once this is finalized, changing it would likely ruin future effort so only changes that improve decisions made (and not significantly change them) would be considered in the future.

### Stage 2: Timeline
The next step is the timeline. The major events that shaped the universe and its denizens need to be ironed out. With the story as-is, this would involve questions like "did humans die before or after the machines were consious?", "What caused human extinction", "what caused the Armada and Cortex to form? and how long did it take for that to happen?"

The Deliverable: a timeline of the events that caused the backstory to be true. perhaps also micro-narratives that describe these events and the details of how they contributed to the backstory/setting being realized. Once the backstory is explained through events, this stage is complete. 

This will probably also need to produce a map of the explored universe and where these events happened, so that stage 3 is easier to fit into the timeline.

### Stage 3: The Details
This is an iterative stage, where gaps in the timeline are filled out with smaller stories that perhaps shape the main characters, but are not the ultimate cause of any backstory fact. This is where Campaigns come from, the smaller and moment to moment stories that impact the universe, but lie completely in the setting. 

The Deliverable: Campaigns! Narratives told (primarily) in game, perhaps also written narratives as well. very character focused, and spanning relatively short time periods.

One example idea is a failed coup attempt on Catreus, where \<insert lead admiral name\> conspires with two armada warriors to betray Catreus, believing it will set Catreus back enough to allow for his demise. However, Catreus eventually defeats them all with risky tactics made at the perfect time that pay off. (I really want to make this campaign lol)

There will be tons of space to fill in the timeline, so this stage will likely last a very long time and will probably be the easiest time to involve the community at large.

### Stage 4: the future
What is now in the story may need to evolve over time, so this would be pursued as needed. if the game changes in a way that necessitates a backstory development (i.e. a universe-changing detail occurs/needs to occur to align with the game again, like a new faction), then focus should be made on a new timeline event, before returning to Stage 3 and filling in details that fall out from that event.
