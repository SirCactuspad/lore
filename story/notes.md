## Faction notes:
- **Armada**: sleek, finesse, order, existence, lawfulness ARMADA unit overview
- **Cortex**: heavy, brutal, might, survival of the fittest CORTEX unit overview
- **Scavenger**: ruthless, mindless, assimilate, deluge, error
- **Raptor**: hive mind, invasive, persistent, aggressive, life, uh, finds a way...

#### Scavs
- The unity, there are no Scavenger leaders and we should never have a perspective paragraph for them.

#### Raptors
- Queens are concious but don't communicate with others, same perspective rules as scavengers
