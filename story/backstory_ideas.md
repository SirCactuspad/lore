# Backstory Brainstorm
This document is to record possibilities and ideas with regard to the backstory, separate from more concrete information

#### Legion Description for notes:
- **Legion**: Rome, Greece, History, Order, efficiency, combine

#### Raptors
- Proposition: If the "hive mind" legion is pursued, What if raptors then weren't a hive mind, but more ant-like where simple rules and communication created complex  and extremely efficient behavior in swarms?

#### Legion
- Legion takes the delay entropy with ultimate efficieny approach. (since the machine life forms are primarily concerned with entropy.)
- Human individuality was a limitation forced on them, legion seeks to be one organism, possibly inspired by how the roman empire, while not an organism, still behaved much like one; self interest, preservation, hunger for resources, self-defense, etc.
- could be a single machine mind that has discovered how to either make limited copies, or deeply integrate itself with countless AI over time.
- Hates the Armada and Cortex for their waste of time and resources in individuality and combat, but Legion must fight them to end combat as soon as possibe, preserving what is left in the universe.
- unfortunately this makes it essentially another hive mind.

#### Misc Backstory Details
- The machine factions cannot replicate machine minds, somehow there was something humans did that allowed machine minds to be created and that info was lost with the humans 
  - This allows character death to be irrevocable loss and carry significant narrative weight.
  - Machine Minds are distinct from AI, having self awareness and emotional variability. 
    - AI then are still quite capable, but only ever follow commands. no true idea of self
- A machine mind uses "commander" units to control an army on a battlefield, but are not (always) themselves a commander. Commander units can temporarily allow multiple minds to access units
  - this aligns with the gameplay of when a commander dies, the player can still control units if there are allies. if all commanders die, the minds no longer have influence over the units and the units self-destruct to deny the victor as much resource as possible.
- A machine mind must be within a certain distance to the battlefield to utilize a commander, so the mind will be at risk.
  - This allows character death to be possible, though rare as most minds retreat the moment their own life could be threatened.
- Of course some battles can be waged by AI as a low-risk alternative, though the machine minds almost always outperform if they are in comparable starting situations.
  - This and the above point allows the factions to be at constant war over millenia and yet have not caused their own extinction... so far
